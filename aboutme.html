  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I grew up in LinkÃ¶ping, Sweden. As a kid I was the one who went hope and the first thing she did was her maths homework, I've always enjoyed studying mathematics. I think it's beautiful, confusing and weird (it doesn't get better than that!). I didn't find high school physics particulary interesting, however, after watching the documentary Particle fever, about the Higgs particle, I started getting curious about the physics path. I obtained a short-term traineeship at CERN second year of high school, and I was really faschinated and decided to study physics for my bachelor's at Stockholm University. Studying both physics and mathematics, I quickly noticed I enjoyed the "pure" mathematics (number theory, combinatorics, group theory etc) more than the typical "physics-maths" (calculuse, differential equations etc) ones. Being hopeful I could combine my favourite mathematical areas with my love for describing the physical universe, I started taking extra maths modules to introduce me to mathematical physics. For my master's, I chose perhaps one of the most mathematical programs in the world: <a href="https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/prospective.html">Part III of the Mathematical Tripos</a> at the Unviersity of Cambridge. Described as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_III_of_the_Mathematical_Tripos">"one of the hardest and most intensive mathematics courses in the world</a>. So far, I've studied QFT, GR, Symmetries (Lie groups and algebras) and will by the end of the course covered string theory, the standard model and supersymmetry. These are great topics for someone like me, and I'm very excited to learn about them! Besides mathematics and physics, I enjoy dancing (in particular Jazz/Showdance) and getting very invested in different TV shows (my top three are Black mirror, BBC Sherlock and Dirk Gently!).
